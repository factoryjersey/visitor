 * grid entries go next, by area, each onto the first page with rows enough
 * for it (three-quarters and a quarter share a page; so do two halves).
 * Listings then fill the rows left, two to a row, and further grids. When
 * the section's listings are rationed to so many pages, those featured in
 * a past guide or with their own guide copy, then new ones, then those
 * with a picture, keep their boxes; the others join the directory lines
 * in the index that follows, by area. Within an area and size, by name.
